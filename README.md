## How to Contribute

We strongly encourage contributors to contribute directly to upstream whenever
possible; contributions will be rejected if we feel they are more appropriate
for a direct upstream contribution (e.g. features for general SQL instead of
SQLite-only queries)

request. All submissions, including submissions by project members, require
review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.

We will also submit patches to our upstream fork for general SQL stuff.
